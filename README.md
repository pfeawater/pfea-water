## Usage
Currently, this automatically synchronizes with a spreadsheet from Google Drive every half hour.  The spreadsheet must be "published to the web", and the spreadsheet can be updated in app.js.  It must conform to the format that is used by our example, https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRwXK01YTeG2PQe1UjKFTzAgRAN18dfLda-O88b0CSBraD4duJkiaEPlpqaCymagDTnOBl-4SUqIAy8/pubhtml.  Specifically, it fetches the last 10 rows and uses every other row as the live data.
